# Diploma Thesis Backend
This repository is my Diploma Thesis Django backend.

The backend stores and processes data for my Diploma Thesis "Experimental Infrastructure for electronic Gecocaching"
The backend is capable of creating new players, giving information about players and about caches, and traveling items.


Future Updates:
1. Use of JWT (JSON Web Token) for token authentication
2. Connecting to other system, mainly creating phone app to work with this
3. Connecting to Frontend (Angular){Will be published in another repository}
