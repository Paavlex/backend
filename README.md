# Diploma Thesis Backend
This repository is my Diploma Thesis Django backend.

### Functions
The backend stores and processes data for my Diploma Thesis "Experimental Infrastructure for electronic Gecocaching"

The backend is capable of creating new players, giving information about players and about caches, and traveling items.

The backend is also able to create orders for new caches, those are saved in the _objednavky_ folder, orsers are saved in .txt and contain a dictionary of needed information
